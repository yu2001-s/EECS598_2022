# EECS 598 Self-Study Project

## Overview

This repository contains my code for  EECS598 by Prof.Justin Johnson in 2022
Setup code is adopted to run on local machine

## Tip
One tip for those doing the same project, remember to restart cuda kernel when encountering cuda error
otherwise even if the code is corrected, the error won't go away
